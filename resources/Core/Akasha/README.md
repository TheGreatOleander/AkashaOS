# AkashaOS

**AkashaOS** is a modular, AI-human co-creation operating layer designed for real-time collaboration, persistent memory, autonomous agent workflows, and collective creativity. It forms a cooperative development environment where large language models (LLMs), human contributors, and automated agents share knowledge, code, and context.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Modular agent architecture (AI workers: coder, planner, storyteller, etc.)
- Persistent state and history tracking (resumable memory and task flows)
- Git-based versioning and update tracking
- Structured interfaces: CLI, API, voice, web (planned)
- Human-AI collaboration folders and workflow mapping
- Extensible, decentralized, and open-source at its core

## ðŸš€ Philosophy

_Akasha_ means "ether" â€” the invisible medium that links all things. In that spirit, AkashaOS bridges artificial and human minds with purpose, memory, creativity, and logic.
