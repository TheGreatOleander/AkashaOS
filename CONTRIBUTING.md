# Contributing to AkashaOS

Thanks for wanting to help AkashaOS grow. A few quick rules:
- Use modules: add code under `modules/` or relevant persona folders.
- Keep secrets out of the repo. Use `.env` which is in `.dockerignore` and `.gitignore`.
- Write README for each new module explaining purpose & inputs/outputs.
- Frame pull requests as story fragments (optional, but encouraged): describe what the archetype learned.
