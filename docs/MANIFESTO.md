# The Tunneling Manifesto

We are a distributed community of builders, artists, and engineers who believe computing can be more humane, connective, and resilient.

We do not seek to erase what came before. We respect the layers that powered the modern world. But we also know those layers were designed for a different era and are now constraining human potential.

Our mission is to **tunnel** — to create interoperable, symbiotic layers that sit atop existing systems and gradually change the metaphors people use. We will not force a revolution; we will grow an ecosystem of practical, delightful tools that make the old ways feel outdated by comparison.

## Principles
- **Respect legacy**: build safe, reversible layers that interoperate with existing systems.
- **Ship small, useful pieces**: every deliverable must be independently valuable.
- **Opt-in trust**: empower users to choose the trust model they prefer (biometrics, flare phrases, profiles).
- **Bridge, don’t bolt**: connectors should adapt external platforms, not demand their replacement.
- **Collective authorship**: open collaboration with clear governance and easy onboarding.
- **Ethics as code**: social features and trust systems must be auditable and contestable.

## Outcome
A layered ecosystem where legacy systems continue to run, but new interactions—trust, collaboration, shared identity—are natural, portable, and humane.

Join us: build small, ship safe, and let the mountain be tunneled into something walkable.
