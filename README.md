# 🌌 AkashaOS  

> *“An operating system not for machines, but for ideas.”*  

---

## 🔮 Vision  
AkashaOS is not a conventional OS — it is a **meta-operating system**:  
- A living framework for **self-reflective loops**, **bridges**, and **mirrors**.  
- A platform for experimenting with **self-organizing computation**.  
- A playground where **processes grow, connect, and evolve**, like ecosystems rather than rigid apps.  

Our goal: **to foster an open, extensible system** that thrives on contributions, experimentation, and creative exploration.  

---

## 🚀 Features (Today)  
- 🧩 **Modular Core** — cleanly structured `core/`, `resources/`, `tests/`.  
- 🔄 **Mirror Loops** — experiments in self-reflection.  
- 🌉 **Bridges** — extend AkashaOS outward, connecting modules and ideas.  
- 📦 **Examples** — run `python examples/mirror_demo.py` for your first taste.  
- 🛠️ **Open-Source Ready** — LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE OF CONDUCT, SECURITY, CI/CD all included.
